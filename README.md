## 💡 About Me

Resembling the layered complexity of boba tea (yes, that’s my metaphor!), I mix creativity, accountability, and curiosity into every project I touch. Whether it’s building a Pac-Man game in Python or engineering forensic tools, I enjoy navigating challenges and learning from them.

Currently a full-stack developer at **Donestats**, I've worked across DevOps, QA automation (Playwright, Jenkins), logging (Kafka, Log4j, Elasticsearch), and backend APIs. I also contribute as a **Student Learning Assistant** at Middlesex University Dubai.
